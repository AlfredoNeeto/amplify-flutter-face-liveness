# AWS Rekognition Face Liveness Plugin for Flutter

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/face_liveness_detector.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/face_liveness_detector)

A Flutter plugin for AWS Rekognition Face Liveness detection, allowing secure face biometric verification using AWS's Rekognition service. This package provides a bridge to the native AWS Amplify Face Liveness SDKs for both Android and iOS.

## Features

- Perform face liveness detection using AWS Rekognition
- Native integration with AWS Amplify Face Liveness SDKs
- Support for both iOS and Android platforms
- Simple Flutter widget interface for easy integration
- Uses AWS Amplify for authentication and credentials

## Requirements

- AWS account with Rekognition access
- AWS Amplify configuration for authentication
- Backend service to create Face Liveness sessions

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  face_liveness_detector: ^0.1.0
```
## ⚙️ Setup PreRequisite

Before using the package, you need to configure **Amplify** in your project. Follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Set Up Amplify

Complete the **[Amplify Quickstart](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/swift/connected-components/liveness#quick-start)** and **[Step 1: Configure Auth](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/swift/connected-components/liveness#step-1-configure-auth)** before proceeding.

### 2️⃣ Configure Authentication

#### Android

1. Add the **Amplify configuration file** to your project:
    - Place `amplifyconfiguration.json` in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`

Update android/app/build.gradle:

android {
    compileSdkVersion 35

    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 24
    }
}
Ensure that the MainActivity class extends FlutterFragmentActivity instead of FlutterActivity:
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

class MainActivity : FlutterFragmentActivity() {}

####iOS
Add the Amplify configuration files to your project:

Place amplifyconfiguration.json and awsconfiguration.json in the ios directory.
Open Xcode and manually add these files to your project to ensure they are recognized.

Update your ios/Podfile:

platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!
Run:
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
3️⃣ Grant Camera Permissions
Ensure you request camera access in both platforms:

Android
Add the following permission in AndroidManifest.xml:

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
iOS
Add this to your Info.plist:

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for face liveness detection.</string>


### Android Setup

1. Make sure you have the AWS Amplify configuration set up properly in your Android project.

2. Add the following dependencies to your `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // AWS Amplify Face Liveness SDK
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework.ui:liveness:1.4.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:core:2.27.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:2.27.0'
}
```

### iOS Setup

**Important**: The AWS Amplify Face Liveness SDK is distributed through Swift Package Manager, not CocoaPods. You need to add the dependencies manually to your iOS project.

#### Step 1: Add Swift Package Dependencies

1. Open your iOS project in Xcode (`ios/Runner.xcworkspace`)
2. Go to **File > Add Package Dependencies...**
3. Add the following packages:

**AWS Amplify Swift:**
- URL: `https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`
- Version: `2.46.1` or later
- Select these products:
  - `Amplify`
  - `AWSCognitoAuthPlugin`

**AWS Amplify UI Liveness:**
- URL: `https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui-swift-liveness`
- Version: `1.3.5` or later
- Select the `FaceLiveness` product

#### Step 2: Configure Amplify

Make sure you have the AWS Amplify configuration set up properly in your iOS project as described in the [AWS Amplify documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/flutter/).

#### Step 3: Add Configuration Files

Place your `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` files in the iOS directory and add them to your Xcode project.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize AWS Amplify

First, make sure you initialize Amplify in your app as described in the [AWS Amplify documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/flutter/).

### 2. Create a Face Liveness Session

You'll need a backend service to create a Face Liveness session. Here's an example of how to get a session ID from your backend:

```dart
Future<Map<String, String>> getSessionFromBackend() async {
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://your-backend-url.com/face-liveness/create-session'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 201) {
    final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
    return {
      'sessionId': data['sessionId'],
      'region': data['region'] ?? 'us-east-1',
    };
  }
  
  throw Exception('Failed to get session');
}
```

### 3. Use the FaceLivenessDetector Widget

```dart
import 'package:face_liveness_detector/face_liveness_detector.dart';

// ...

FaceLivenessDetector(
  sessionId: sessionId,
  region: 'us-east-1',
  onComplete: () {
    print('Face liveness detection completed successfully');
    // Fetch results from your backend
  },
  onError: (errorCode) {
    print('Face liveness detection error: $errorCode');
  },
)
```

### 4. Fetch Liveness Results

After the liveness check is complete, you should verify the results with your backend:

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> fetchLivenessResults({
  required String sessionId,
}) async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://your-backend-url.com/face-liveness/results?sessionId=$sessionId'),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    return jsonDecode(response.body);
  }
  
  throw Exception('Failed to fetch liveness results');
}
```

## Example

Check the `example` directory for a complete example app.

## Backend Implementation

You'll need a backend service that can:

1. Create Face Liveness sessions using the AWS SDK
2. Fetch Face Liveness results after completion

A simple implementation using Spring Boot is provided in the example directory.
